## Overview

- Users can choose the difficulty level - standard (Rock/Paper/Scissors) or advanced (Rock/Paper/Scissors/Lizard/Spock).
- Based on the selected difficulty, users will see a different game board.
- From the main game board screen, users can go back to the selection screen to choose a different difficulty level.
- By clicking on the 'Rules' button, users can open a modal with simple rules explanation according to the selected difficulty level.
- Once the user clicks on one of the game buttons, they are forwarded to a result screen where they wait for the computer to select their figure.
- There can be 3 possible results: draw, win or loss.
- Score is updated accordingly for each difficulty level and is stored within the local storage.
